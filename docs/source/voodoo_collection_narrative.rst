In one of these realities, transcending the physical universe and the virtual reality known as the **Omniverse**, there exist five legendary houses. Each house is recognized for its unique attributes and the distinctive **Voodoo dolls** they possess. Over time, these dolls have been divided into **twenty races**, with four in each **house**, and each race bearing its own **ancestral surname**.

In this reality, each house is led by a powerful leader who governs their domain. The houses coexist harmoniously, with each leader ensuring the prosperity and stability of their respective territories. As the houses flourished, **they became home to 10,000 Voodoo dolls, born from various races and surnames**.

Over time, these Voodoo dolls evolved; some maintaining their pure lineages, while others mingled with different races. This blending resulted in dolls with a range of powers and abilities, each more astonishing than the last. The more race combinations a Voodoo doll possesses, the more valuable it becomes in the Omniverse.

The role of the leaders, with the help of the Voodoos, is to promote diversity so that the bonds between the houses strengthen and the world becomes an even more magical place, where the legacy of extraordinary experiences endures for generations in the vast and boundless expanse.
